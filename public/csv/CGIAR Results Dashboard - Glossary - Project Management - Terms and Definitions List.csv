Term,Definition,Trigger
The Sphere of Control,The direct products of CGIAR research.,Sphere of control
Outputs,"Knowledge, technical or institutional advancement produced by CGIAR research, engagement and/or capacity development activities. Examples of outputs include new research methods, policy analyses, gene maps, new crop varieties and breeds, institutional innovations or other products of research work.",Sphere of control
Peer review,A process of review involving qualified individuals within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of relevance and quality to improve performance and provide credibility. A peer review may be an input into an evaluation.,Sphere of control
The Sphere of Influence,Where CGIAR may have some input but cannot control the outcome (such as contribution to a policy decision).,Sphere of influence
Outcome,"A change in knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or relationships, manifest as a change in behavior, to which research outputs and related activities have contributed.",Sphere of influence
Evaluation,"The systematic and objective assessment of an on‐going or completed project, program or policy, its design, implementation and results. In the CGIAR evaluation refers to an external, completely (IEA commissioned) or largely (CRP commissioned) independent and systematic study of an in‐depth nature that uses clear evaluation criteria. In addition to research, it applies also to central CGIAR institutions, support programs and themes, and the System as a whole. An evaluation should provide information that is credible and useful, enabling the incorporation of lessons learned into the decision‐making processes of major stakeholders.",Sphere of influence
The Sphere of Interest,"Where CGIAR has very little control and which may happen many years after the research, such as adoption by farmers of a technology at large scale and at their own cost.",Sphere of interest
Impact,"A change in state resulting from a chain of events to which research outputs and related activities have contributed. Some examples: crop yield, farm productivity, household wealth (state) income (flow), quality of water (state), water flow (flow).""",Sphere of interest
Sustainability,The continuation of benefits from a program intervention after research has been completed; the probability of continued long‐term benefits or scalability of the benefits; the resilience to risk of the net benefit flows over time.,Sphere of interest
