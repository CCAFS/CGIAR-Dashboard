The Sphere of Control,The direct products of CGIAR research.,x,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outputs,"Knowledge, technical or institutional advancement produced by CGIAR research, engagement and/or capacity development activities. Examples of outputs include new research methods, policy analyses, gene maps, new crop varieties and breeds, institutional innovations or other products of research work.",x,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peer review,A process of review involving qualified individuals within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of relevance and quality to improve performance and provide credibility. A peer review may be an input into an evaluation.,x,,,,,,,,x,,,,
The Sphere of Influence,Where CGIAR may have some input but cannot control the outcome (such as contribution to a policy decision).,,x,,,,,,,,,,,
Outcome,"A change in knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or relationships, manifest as a change in behavior, to which research outputs and related activities have contributed.",,x,,,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation,"The systematic and objective assessment of an on‐going or completed project, program or policy, its design, implementation and results. In the CGIAR evaluation refers to an external, completely (IEA commissioned) or largely (CRP commissioned) independent and systematic study of an in‐depth nature that uses clear evaluation criteria. In addition to research, it applies also to central CGIAR institutions, support programs and themes, and the System as a whole. An evaluation should provide information that is credible and useful, enabling the incorporation of lessons learned into the decision‐making processes of major stakeholders.",,x,,,,,,,,,,,
The Sphere of Interest,"Where CGIAR has very little control and which may happen many years after the research, such as adoption by farmers of a technology at large scale and at their own cost.",,,x,,,,,,,,,,
Impact,"A change in state resulting from a chain of events to which research outputs and related activities have contributed. Some examples: crop yield, farm productivity, household wealth (state) income (flow), quality of water (state), water flow (flow).""",,,x,,,,,,,,,,
Sustainability,The continuation of benefits from a program intervention after research has been completed; the probability of continued long‐term benefits or scalability of the benefits; the resilience to risk of the net benefit flows over time.,,,x,,,,,,,,,,
Training,Capacity development,,,,x,,,,,,,,,
Innnovation,"Research and development innovations are new or significantly improved (adaptive) outputs or groups of outputs - including management practices, knowledge or technologies. This could also refer to a significant research finding, method or tool. A significant improvement is one that allows the management practice, knowledge or technology to serve a new purpose or a new class of users to employ it, for example a new variety, a blend of fertilizer for a particular soil type, or a tool modified to suit a particular management practice (see Outputs).

SLO,System Level Outcomes.,,,,,,,x,,,,,,
Partnerships,Partnerships.,,,,,,,,x,,,,,
Milestones,"A time bound target that reflects progress towards a planned result. Milestones include both outputs, output use and outcomes along CRP impact pathways as appropriate to the scale and maturity of the work.
