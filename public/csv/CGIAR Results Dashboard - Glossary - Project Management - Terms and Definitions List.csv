Quasi-experimental design,"Impact evaluation designs used to determine impact in the absence of a control group from an experimental design. Many quasi-experimental methods create a comparison group using statistical procedures. The intention is to ensure that the characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups are identical in all respects, other than the intervention, as would be the case from an experimental design. Other, regression-based approaches, have an implicit counterfactual, controlling for selection bias and other confounding factors through statistical procedures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Random assignment,"An intervention design in which members of the eligible population are assigned at random to either the treatment group or the control group (i.e. random assignment). That is, whether someone is in the treatment or control group is solely a matter of chance, and not a function of any of their characteristics (either observed or unobserved).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Randomized control trial (RCT),"An impact evaluation design in which random assignment has been used to allocate the intervention amongst members of the eligible population. Differences in outcome between the treatment and control can be fully attributed to the intervention, i.e. there is no selection bias. However, RCTs may be subject to several types of bias and so need follow strict protocols. Also called Experimental design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scaling up and scaling out,"In agricultural development the terms are used nearly interchangeably to refer to the expansion of beneficial impacts from agricultural research and rural development. Scaling up/out relate to expanding, replicating, adapting, and sustaining successful policies, programs, or projects in geographic space or over time to reach a greater number of people. Scaling is typically preceded by piloting the model, idea or approach initially in a small scale. Scaling‐out may refer specifically to the adoption and adaptation to local circumstances by users; while scaling‐up may refer to extension and institutional support related to scaling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
